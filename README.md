TODO: Make the morse-code use the PWM buzzer.
See ~/Documents/School/SFU/Computing Science (CMPT)/Embedded Systems (CMPT 433)/Assignments/4/Guides/PWMGuide.pdf on my Mac
and look at ~/cmpt433/work/linux/include/linux/pwm.h for the kernel APIs for accessing PWM devices. Should be able to figure it out from there.
